      <p>I get new allergies all the time, and someone told me apples might be next. <br>
        Which really sucks beacuse I love apples, and to be honest, if I can't eat fresh apples then what can I eat, you know?</p>

      <h2>My Drawing</h2>
      <p>My childhood friends cat, Leo, died going on two years ago now. This cat was her LIFE. <br>
        Usually we make each other things for birthdays, and I can't knit or crochet like she can so I tend to draw or paint something for her.
        I decided to recreate a picture I took of Leo through digital art. That picture is what I have chosen to display here on this website. <br>
        It made her cry all over her cake, and though that was not the desired outcome (seeing that it had been over a year since he died), I'm glad it was good enough to make her think of the cat instead of my subpar art skills. <br>
        It is one of my favourite pieces I've ever done.</p>

          The end is nothing we could even imagine.<br>
          Contemplation is at its peak,<br>
          Yet we strive to reach beyond<br>
          <br>

          We are but stardust looking to be planets,<br>
          Searching for something, somewhere to take the jagged edges of our humanity<br>
          And shape us into a version like itself.<br>
          <br>

          Lies, war and hatred between the children of space<br>
          The prisoners of time that will never stop running out.<br>
          We kill and destroy and die for a story<br>
          <br>

          A tale told by mouths in tongues unknown to us<br>
          Incomprehensible, yet we bow down to a king made of smoke.<br>
          A legend of mirrors,<br>
          With nothing but darkness at the end of the tunnel, we fall<br>
          <br>

          So take what is mine and sheath me in the moulds<br>
          That you did not make nor find<br>
          Just trust in, blindly<br>
          <br>

          I am but space dust drifting in infinity<br>
          I shape my own jagged edges,<br>
          The energy of the universe carries me along to a place I don't yet know<br>
          <br>

          But you keep on waiting,<br>
          Scorning the drifters of time and space like we are different from you.<br>
          Like you are more than just dust<br>
          <br>

          Lost in the sheath of smoke and mirrors.<br>
          Asceticism,<br>
          For a king of dust.
